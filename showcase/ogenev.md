## About Me

I'm a software engineer interested in distributed systems and blockchain. 
I used to work for a commodity trading house and a fintech company.
I love programming, snowboarding, and weightlifting. Before starting my software engineering journey,
I was a successful online mid-high stakes poker player.

## My CDAP Project

During the course of the apprenticeship program, my main focus was working on [Portal Network] and [Trin] - an Ethereum portal
client.

I learned about [Kademlia DHT] and I gained good intuition on what is needed to build DHT networks on top of the existing [Discovery protocol v5].
I dived into its implementation [in Rust], spend a lot of time dissecting [portal wire protocol], [State Network], and [History network] specs, and started [contributing] to Trin.
